        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                The Royal Game of Ur is one of the longest-lived games in
                history, with evidence of it being enjoyed by people that
                lived over the course of many
                <span class="italics">thousands</span> of years. This
                affords the game a huge wealth of history to explore and
                discover, and in fact, you can
                <span class="italics">experience this history yourself</span>
                by playing the game! You would think that a game
                that has lasted millenia would be fun, and it
                <span class="italics">is</span> fun!
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is made for two players with a board, 5 or 7 pieces
                per player, and 4 two-sided dice. The exact rules that were
                played thousands of years ago is hard to deduce (and likely
                changed over time!). However, academics have used
                ancient artifacts and the writing on old cuneiform tablets
                to discover several likely options. However, the rules for
                the game that have become the most popular in this millenia
                are the ones presented in the 2017 YouTube video
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I">Tom Scott vs. Irving Finkel</a>.

        <h2>Why was RoyalUr.net started?</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                The video that cemented Irving Finkel as an icon of this game
                also inspired <a href="https://paddy-lamont.com/">Padraig X. Lamont</a>
                to start a hobby project. And so, over one Christmas, many slices of
                Christmas ham, and many hot chocolates, a fledgling version
                of this website was born! That fledgling hobby project has since
                grown up, and we are now proud to boast an average of 500 games
                played every day on RoyalUr.net. However, in an even bigger
                accomplishment, we are also proud to have grown a rich Discord
                community of over 700 people that are enthusiastic about the
                Royal Game of Ur. This community welcomes both serious and casual
                players, as well as academics! And that is why we are so excited
                to have you join us here, to share in the game we all love.
