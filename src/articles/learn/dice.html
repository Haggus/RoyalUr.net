            <h1>üé≤ Dice used in The Royal Game of Ur</h1>
            <hr/>

            <p>
                In The Royal Game of Ur, even if you are losing, a few lucky rolls
                at the right time could win you the game! This page goes through
                the different types of dice used in the game, and the probabilities
                of your rolls. Any set of four D2 dice can be used to play The Royal
                Game of Ur, although tetrahedral dice are the most commonly used.
                Here, D2 refers to the fact that the dice used have two equally likely
                outcomes.
            </p>

            <h2>Tetrahedral Dice</h2>
            <div id="dice-container">
                <include src="src/game/ui/dice.html" />
                <span id="dice-prompt" style="display: none">Click to roll!</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                The most commonly used dice when playing The Royal Game of Ur
                are the tetrahedral dice, which are dice that are shaped like
                triangle-based pyramids. Each die has two corners marked
                with white, and two unmarked corners. After rolling the dice,
                you can count the number of die with a marked corner facing
                upwards to get your roll.
            </p>

            <h2>Throwing Stick Dice</h2>
            <img id="stick-dice" class="shadow" data-src="/res/stick_dice.[ver]" alt="Example Throwing Stick Dice" />
            <p>
                Throwing sticks are another type of dice that are commonly used
                to play The Royal Game of Ur. Throwing stick dice are flat sticks
                with one side marked. You can then throw the sticks and count the
                number of sticks with their marked side up. Throwing stick dice
                are commonly used in another ancient game,
                <a href="https://www.ancientgames.org/aseb-game-20-squares/">Aseb</a>,
                which is another ancient game that is very similar to The Royal
                Game of Ur. These two games are so common that they actually both
                share another name, which is The Game of 20 Squares.

        <!-- About the probability of the dice used in the game. -->
        <section>
            <h2>Probability</h2>
            <h3>One die</h3>
            <img id="one-die" class="shadow" data-src="/res/dice_up1.[ver]" alt="Die with a marked corner up" />
            <p>
                When using a single die, there is a 50% chance that it will
                land with its marked corner or side up. This means that for
                each individual die, you have a 50/50 chance of getting a one.
            </p>
            <h3>Four dice</h3>
            <div id="four-die">
                <img class="shadow" data-src="/res/dice_down2.[ver]" alt="Die with a marked corner up" />
                <img class="shadow" data-src="/res/dice_down1.[ver]" alt="Die with an unmarked corner up" />
                <br/>
                <img class="shadow" data-src="/res/dice_up3.[ver]" alt="Die with an unmarked corner up" />
                <img class="shadow" data-src="/res/dice_down2.[ver]" alt="Die with an unmarked corner up" />
            </div>
            <p>
                When using four dice, you have to count the results of the
                four individual die. This means that it is possible to get
                a total of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The chances of each of these
                possibilities is respectively 1, 4, 6, 4, and 1 out of 16.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that you have a 6.25% chance of rolling a 0,
                a 25% chance of rolling a 1, a 37.5% chance of rolling
                a 2, a 25% chance of rolling a 3, and a 6.25% chance
                of rolling a 4.
            </p>
            <p>

                If you'd like to understand why these are the probabilities
                of each roll, the user rodecss on slideshare made a great
                presentation that goes into detail on calculating the
                probability of each roll. Check it out

            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <p>
                Now that you know the probability of each roll is not the
                same, you can likely anticipate that this affects the best
                strategies to use while playing the game, and it does!
                Here are some tips for picking the best moves,
            </p>
            <h3>1. Avoid two spaces in front of your opponent's pieces</h3>
            <p>
                Preferably, we'd avoid putting our own pieces in front of our
                opponents all the time. Unfortunately though, sometimes you have to
                make progress and move your pieces in front of your opponents.
                If you have the option, it is safer to do this by placing your
                pieces 1 or 3 tiles ahead of your opponent's piece, instead of
                2. This will slightly reduce their chances of being able to take
                your piece on their turn.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also valuable to note that if your piece is 4 tiles ahead of
                your opponent's, it is very unlikely that they will be able to take
                it! Therefore, instead of moving that piece maybe it would be better
                to move a new piece onto the board, or develop your less advanced
                pieces.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Place your pieces two spaces behind your opponent's</h3>
            <p>
                For the opposite reasons to point 1, if you are looking to take
                one of your opponent's pieces, it is best to get your pieces
                two spaces behind theirs. This will give you the best chance of
                being able to take their piece on your next turn.
            </p>
