                If you'd like to meet people who also love the Game of Ur, or just want to show
                off your skills at the game, we'd love to have you join one of our community tournaments!
            </p>
            <p>
                We have held <a href="/tournaments/first">one tournament</a> so far, and we plan
                to host many more in the future! Our first tournament was a great success with
                Aratkovich winning the <a href="/tournaments/first/gold-aratkovich.pdf">gold medal</a>,
                and Timogustafson narrowly taking
                <a href="/tournaments/first/silver-timogustafson.pdf">second place</a>!
                The tournament did have a few hiccups, but nevertheless it was a very enjoyable
                morning!

                which allows us to chat and discuss how we want them to run. If you'd like to take part
                in our next tournament, a good way to sign up is to join our Discord server. When we
