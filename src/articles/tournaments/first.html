            <p>
                We held our first tournament on Sunday the 16th of May, 2021! We had 10 competitors take
                part, for an enjoyable morning of twenty squares!
            </p>
            <p>
                A big congratulations to the skill of everyone who took part! It was a tense tournament
                down to the very final game, where in an upset Aratkovich defeated the yet undefeated
                Timogustafson 7 to 4! I had a lot of fun meeting and playing against you all!

            <h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
            <p>
                Most of our competitors were from the US, Brazil, and Mexico, and so the tournament
                was scheduled for Sunday morning, at 10AM Central Standard Time! Everyone arrived
                bright and early for the tournament, although it took me some time to organise the
                schedule, so round one didn't start until 10:30AM.
            </p>

            <h3 id="round-one">Round One</h3>
            <p>
                The tournament started off in style with round one having every competitor play three
                games to narrow down the field from the original 10, down to the final 4! After some
                tense, nail-biting games, Timogustafson was the only player to go undefeated for the
                first round! In second place, Zakk Lightman, Ella Roman, Aratkovich, and Nitt all had 2 wins
                and 1 loss at the end of round one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, there were only 4 places in the finals, but 5 players to fill those
                positions! To break this tie, we used the player's total tiles scored from all their
                games in round one. This led to Zakk Lightman unfortunately not making it into the
                final 4, as he only scored 4 tiles in his game against Diego Raposo.
            </p>

            <h3 id="round-two">Round Two</h3>
            <p>
                Round two started off with the round one leader Timogustafson playing Nitt, and Aratkovich
                playing Ella Roman. These were both tense games, with Timogustafson continuing his winning
                streak by beating Nitt 7 to 6, and Aratkovich defeating Ella Roman 7 to 4. The next game
                had Timogustafson defeat Ella roman 7 to 4, and Aratkovich beating Nitt 7 to 6!
            </p>
            <p>
                After only these two games, the best of 3 games had already been decided, with Timogustafson
                and Aratkovich both having already won 2 games each! Therefore, the third game in this round
                was skipped, and we went straight to the finals!
            </p>

            <h3 id="final-matches">Final Matches</h3>
            <p>
                For the final match, Nitt and Ella Roman competed for 3rd place, while Timogustafson and
                Aratkovich competed for the illustrious Tournament Winner title! Nitt and Ella Roman's
                game was quite quick, with Nitt taking 3rd place with a score of 7 to Ella Roman's 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                This brought us to the final match between Timogustafson and Aratkovich! Thanks to recent
                changes, everyone was able to spectate this match as it came to an exciting end with
                Aratkovich managing to sneak through with a 7 to 4 win!

            <h2 id="future-tournaments">Future Tournaments</h2>
            <p>
                Our first ever tournament was a great success, and I hope we can host many more future
                tournaments with similar enjoyment! There were however some learnings from this tournament
                that we will try to address before the next tournament!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The names on the games generated by the RoyalUr.net Discord Bot sometimes glitched,
                    which led to the games often having to be re-generated a few times to get working.
                    This software bug should hopefully be fixed for next time!
                </li>
                <li>
                    We split the competitors in <a href="round-one">Round One</a> into two pools of players.
                    This was a good idea when we had 8 competitors as then each pool would have no byes,
                    however, with 5 people in each pool this just led to more confusion and skipped games!
                    In the future, it would be better to come up with a better solution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At the end of round one, we had 5 competitors that had qualified for the finals, however
                    only 4 places. This led to us having to eliminate Zakk Lightman despite him winning two
                    of his three games! In the future, it would be good to make it clearer how these tie
                    breaking situations will be handled.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                One of our community members, Diego Raposo, made certificates for everyone who took
                part in the tournament! A big thankyou to Diego for making them so we can have
                these certificates to commemorate the event!
