This repository holds the client code for [RoyalUr.net](https://royalur.net).
The server code for RoyalUr.net can be found in the
[RoyalUrServer repository](https://github.com/Sothatsit/RoyalUrServer).

RoyalUr.net was created based upon the ancient Sumerian board game, The Royal Game of Ur,
in the British Museum. The original board game can be dated to 2600 BC, and was discovered
in a royal tomb in the city-state of Ur in ancient Mesopotamia.  Learn more about the game
on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur), or watch a fun match
between Tom Scott and Irving Finkel on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/WZskjLq040I)!

The game also has a Discord and a Reddit that you might want to check out! The Discord
can be used to chat about the game, find worthy opponents to challenge, discuss the
development of RoyalUr.net, and it also contains a changelog with a summary of the changes
being made to the website.

# üñ•Ô∏è Compilation
This project uses Babel to transpile all Javascript to a single ES5 compatible file,
as well as a Python script to generate the resource files needed for the site.

The following commands will compile the site to _./compiled_: \
`./compile.sh release` -- Full clean compilation, with minified JS. \
`./compile.sh dev` -- No minification, no cleaning of _./compiled_ folder.

**If you run into ./res file related issues during
compilation, try updating your ./res folder.**

To update the contents of your ./res folder as the resources used by RoyalUrClient
change, simply delete it and let the compilation script download it again for you.


# üõ†Ô∏è Project Architecture
A summary of the architecture of the client-side of RoyalUr.net can be found in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### üíæ Resource Files
The image, audio, and annotation assets required by the project are not actually
stored in git, due to git's poor handling of binary files. Instead, the script
to compile the site will automatically download the resources for you from
https://royalur.net/res.zip.
