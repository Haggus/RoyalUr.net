            RoyalUr.net uses the path and rules popularised by
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Finkel">Dr Irving Finkel</a>
            and his analysis of the game. Dr Irving Finkel is the historian
            who originally discovered the rules of The Royal Game of Ur in
            the early 1980s through his deciphering of an ancient cuneiform tablet.

        <h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
        <h3 id="roll-the-dice">1. Roll the Dice.</h3>
        <p>
            Click on your dice to roll them. The value shown is how far you can
            move one of your pieces!
        </p>
        <p>
            You can find the value of the dice yourself by counting all dice
            that have their marked corner up after rolling. Each die has 2
            marked corners, and 2 unmarked corners, giving each dice a 50/50
            chance of having their marked corner up.
        </p>

        <h3 id="move-a-piece">2. Move a Piece.</h3>
        <p>
            Moving your pieces is the core mechanic of Ur! You can move your pieces
            by the value of the dice that you have rolled, and they follow the path
            shown under <a href="rules">Rules</a> above.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you can't move a piece, your turn will be skipped. If you can move
            a piece, you must move it! You cannot choose to not move a piece.
        </p>
        <p>
            On desktop, you can click a piece to move it. On mobile, you can drag
            or double tap the piece you wish to move.
        </p>
        <img class="shadow" data-src="/res/example_move.[ver]" alt="Example Move" />

        <h3 id="capture-pieces">3. Capture your opponent's pieces.</h3>
        <p>
            You can capture your opponent's pieces by moving your pieces
            over their pieces in the middle row! Capturing your opponent's
            pieces is a great way to stop them getting all of their pieces
            off the board before you!
        </p>
        <p>
            Beware though, the middle rosette is a safe tile!
            You cannot take pieces on rosette tiles.
        </p>

        <h2>Rosette Tiles</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Extra Moves:</strong>
            Moving your tiles onto rosette tiles gives you another move!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Safe:</strong>
            Pieces on rosette tiles cannot be taken!
