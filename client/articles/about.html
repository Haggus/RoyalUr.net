            <h1>About RoyalUr.net</h1>
            <hr/>

            <p>
                RoyalUr.net is a free and open-source website for people to play and learn about
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur" target="_blank">The Royal Game of Ur</a>.
                Currently the website has about 70 games played per day from people all around the world!
            </p>
            <p>
                The RoyalUr.net project was started in 2017 by
                <a href="https://github.com/Sothatsit">Paddy Lamont</a>
                as a hobby project, and was open-sourced on
                <a href="https://github.com/Sothatsit/RoyalUrClient">GitHub</a>
                in 2019. Since then, many people have joined the RoyalUr.net community
                and have assisted in its development, troubleshooting, and community building!

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Provide a fun place for people to play The Royal Game of Ur!</li>
                <li>Teach people about the game, its rules, and its strategy</li>
                <li>Make learning history engaging!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                We still have a long way to go in achieving these goals, but
                we are well on our way with our <a href="/game">webgame</a> that
                lets people play the game locally or online, and our study of strategy through
                <a href="https://github.com/Sothatsit/RoyalUrAnalysis/">RoyalUrAnalysis</a>.
                Incorporating the history of the game into the website is our current priority.

                way is to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/FbCp76esgb">Discord</a>!
                On Discord we can help you with navigating the codebase, discuss the work

            <h2>Sponsor the Site</h2>
            <p>
                This website is completely free, open source, and ad-free!
                Unfortunately, that means that the website has no revenue,
                and therefore hosting costs come from my own pocket. If you
                would like to help me pay for the hosting of RoyalUr.net,
                then feel free to buy me a coffee at the link below :)
